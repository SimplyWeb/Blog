                    <h2 class="section-heading">Kevin Mitnick</h2>
                        <p>Hackers have been around since the dawn of computers, and they've wreaked more havoc than many people realize. Law enforcement has yet to catch up with many of their antics. Of these one of the most influential is Kevin Mitnick.
                        Mitnick became the world’s most notorious black hat hacker, breaking into the networks of companies like IBM, Nokia, Motorola, and other targets. After a stint in prison, he reinvented himself as a white hat hacker, selling his skills as a penetration tester and security consultant. With his latest business venture, Mitnick has switched hats again: This time to an ambiguous shade of grey.</p>

                        <h3>Black Hat</h3>

                            <p>At age 15, Mitnick used social engineering and dumpster diving[9] to bypass the punch card system used in the Los Angeles bus system. After a friendly bus driver told him where he could buy his own ticket punch, he could ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused transfer slips he found in the trash. Social engineering later became his primary method of obtaining information, including user-names and passwords and modem phone numbers.

                            <p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks while he was a fugitive. He used cloned cellular phones to hide his location and, among other things, copied valuable proprietary software from some of the country's largest cellular telephone and computer companies. Mitnick also intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke into and read private e-mail.

                            <p>After a well-publicized pursuit, the FBI arrested Mitnick on February 15,1995, at his apartment in Raleigh, North Carolina, on federal offenses related to a 2½-year period of computer hacking which included computer and wire fraud.

                        <h3>White Hat</h3>
                            
                            <p>In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. He claims he did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security.
                            <p>Since 2000, Mitnick has been a paid security consultant, public speaker and author. He does security consulting for Fortune 500 companies, performs penetration testing services for the world's largest companies and teaches Social Engineering classes to dozens of companies and government agencies.




                        <h3>Grey Hat</h3>
                            
                            <p>Mitnick revealed a new branch of his security consultancy business he calls Mitnick’s Absolute Zero Day Exploit Exchange. Since its quiet inception, he says the service has offered to sell corporate and government clients high-end “zero-day” exploits, hacking tools that take advantage of secret bugs in software for which no patch yet exists. Mitnick says he’s offering exploits developed both by his own in-house researchers and by outside hackers, guaranteed to be exclusive and priced at no less than $100,000 each, including his own fee. These Customers are not required to share what the purpose of these exploits are, furthurmore Mitnick's company doesn't want to know.
